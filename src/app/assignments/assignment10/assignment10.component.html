    Create a routing enabled Angular app to demonstrate the routing between 2 static
    components. Create one component named as “First” and another named as “Second”.
    Define the routes for the 2 components using the “Routes” array. Add the route links in
    the “app” component with “&lt;routesLink&gt;”. Lastly add “&lt;router-outlet&gt;&lt;/router-outlet&gt;” to
