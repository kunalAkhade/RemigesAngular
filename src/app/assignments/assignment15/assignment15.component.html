      Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few
      implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers
      write once, run anywhere (WORA),[16] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java
      without the need to recompile.[17] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java
      virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and
      C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as
      reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages. Java
      gained popularity shortly after its release, and has been a very popular programming language since then.[18] Java
      was the third most popular programming language in 2022 according to GitHub.[19] Although still widely popular,
      there has been a gradual decline in use of Java in recent years with other languages using JVM gaining
      popularity.[20] Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems. It was released in May 1995 as a
      core component of Sun's Java platform. The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines,
      and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with
      the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the
      GPL-2.0-only license. Oracle offers its own HotSpot Java Virtual Machine, however the official reference
      implementation is the OpenJDK JVM which is free open-source software and used by most developers and is the default
      JVM for almost all Linux distributions. As of September 2024, Java 23 is the latest version (Java 22, and 20 are no
      longer maintained). Java 8, 11, 17, and 21 are previous LTS versions still officially supported. History See also:

      @else if (selectedTab == 'ANGULAR') {
      Angular (also referred to as "Angular 2+")[4] is a TypeScript-based free and open-source single-page web application
      framework. It is developed by Google and by a community of individuals and corporations. Angular is a complete
      rewrite from the same team that built AngularJS. The Angular ecosystem consists of a diverse group of over 1.7
      million developers, library authors, and content creators.[5] According to the Stack Overflow Developer Survey,
      Angular is one of the most commonly used web frameworks.[6]

      Differences between Angular and AngularJS

      Architecture of an Angular application, services, and dependency injection
      Google designed Angular as a ground-up rewrite of AngularJS. Unlike AngularJS, Angular does not have a concept of
      "scope" or controllers; instead, it uses a hierarchy of components as its primary architectural characteristic.[7]
      Angular has a different expression syntax, focusing on "[ ]" for property binding, and "( )" for event binding.[8]
      Angular recommends the use of Microsoft's TypeScript language, which introduces features such as static typing,
      generics, and type annotations.

      Features
      Component-based architecture
      Angular uses a component-based architecture, which allows developers to build encapsulated, reusable user interface
      elements. Each component encapsulates its own HTML, CSS, and TypeScript, making it easier to manage and test
      individual pieces of an application.[9]

      Data binding
      Angular supports two-way data binding, which synchronizes data between the model and the view. This ensures that any
      changes in the view are automatically reflected in the model and vice versa.[10]

      Dependency injection
      Angular has a built-in dependency injection system that makes it easier to manage and inject dependencies into
      components and services. This promotes modularity and easier testing.[11]

      Directives
      Angular extends HTML with additional attributes called directives. Directives offer functionality to change the
      behavior or appearance of DOM elements.[12]

      Routing
      Angular includes a router that allows developers to define and manage application states and navigation paths,
      making it easier to build single-page applications with complex routing.[13]

      Angular CLI
      The Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) provides a set of tools for creating, building, testing, and deploying
      Angular applications. It enables rapid application setup and simplifies ongoing development tasks.[14]

      Server-side rendering
      Angular has official support for server-side rendering, which improves an application's load time and performance.
      Server-side rendering also enhances search engine optimization by making content more accessible to web
      crawlers.[15]

      History
      Angular 2.0 was announced at the ng-Europe conference 22–23 October 2014.[16] On April 30, 2015, the Angular
      developers announced that Angular 2 moved from Alpha to Developer Preview.[17] Angular 2 moved to Beta in December
      2015,[18] and the first release candidate was published in May 2016.[19] The final version was released on 14
      September 2016.

      Version 8 of Angular introduced a new compilation and rendering pipeline, Ivy, and version 9 of Angular enabled Ivy
      by default. Angular 13 removed the deprecated former compiler, View Engine.[20] The Angular Renaissance started on
      June 2, 2022 with the release of v14, when the transformation towards de-emphasizing the use of modules in favor of
      a more modern and streamlined approach to application structure.

      Naming
      The rewrite of AngularJS was called "Angular 2", but this led to confusion among developers. To clarify, the team
      announced that separate names should be used for each framework with "AngularJS" referring to the 1.X versions and
      "Angular" without the "JS" referring to versions 2 and up.[21]

      @else if (selectedTab == 'SQL') {
      Structured Query Language (SQL) (pronounced /ˌɛsˌkjuˈɛl/ S-Q-L; or alternatively as /ˈsiːkwəl/ "sequel")[4][5] is a
      domain-specific language used to manage data, especially in a relational database management system (RDBMS). It is
      particularly useful in handling structured data, i.e., data incorporating relations among entities and variables.

      Introduced in the 1970s, SQL offered two main advantages over older read–write APIs such as ISAM or VSAM. Firstly,
      it introduced the concept of accessing many records with one single command. Secondly, it eliminates the need to
      specify how to reach a record, i.e., with or without an index.

      Originally based upon relational algebra and tuple relational calculus, SQL consists of many types of statements,[6]
      which may be informally classed as sublanguages, commonly: Data query Language (DQL), Data Definition Language
      (DDL), Data Control Language (DCL), and Data Manipulation Language (DML).[7]

      The scope of SQL includes data query, data manipulation (insert, update, and delete), data definition (schema
      creation and modification), and data access control. Although SQL is essentially a declarative language (4GL), it
      also includes procedural elements.

      SQL was one of the first commercial languages to use Edgar F. Codd's relational model. The model was described in
      his influential 1970 paper, "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks".[8] Despite not entirely
      adhering to the relational model as described by Codd, SQL became the most widely used database language.[9][10]

      SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986 and of the International
      Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987.[11] Since then, the standard has been revised multiple times to
      include a larger set of features and incorporate common extensions. Despite the existence of standards, virtually no
      implementations in existence adhere to it fully, and most SQL code requires at least some changes before being
      ported to different database systems.

      History
      SQL was initially developed at IBM by Donald D. Chamberlin and Raymond F. Boyce after learning about the relational
      model from Edgar F. Codd[12] in the early 1970s.[13] This version, initially called SEQUEL (Structured English Query
      Language), was designed to manipulate and retrieve data stored in IBM's original quasirelational database management
      system, System R, which a group at IBM San Jose Research Laboratory had developed during the 1970s.[13]

      Chamberlin and Boyce's first attempt at a relational database language was SQUARE (Specifying Queries in A
      Relational Environment), but it was difficult to use due to subscript/superscript notation. After moving to the San
      Jose Research Laboratory in 1973, they began work on a sequel to SQUARE.[12] The original name SEQUEL, which is
      widely regarded as a pun on QUEL, the query language of Ingres,[14] was later changed to SQL (dropping the vowels)
      because "SEQUEL" was a trademark of the UK-based Hawker Siddeley Dynamics Engineering Limited company.[15] The label
      SQL later became the acronym for Structured Query Language.

      After testing SQL at customer test sites to determine the usefulness and practicality of the system, IBM began
      developing commercial products based on their System R prototype, including System/38, SQL/DS, and IBM Db2, which
      were commercially available in 1979, 1981, and 1983, respectively.[16]

      In the late 1970s, Relational Software, Inc. (now Oracle Corporation) saw the potential of the concepts described by
      Codd, Chamberlin, and Boyce, and developed their own SQL-based RDBMS with aspirations of selling it to the U.S.
      Navy, Central Intelligence Agency, and other U.S. government agencies. In June 1979, Relational Software introduced
      one of the first commercially available implementations of SQL, Oracle V2 (Version2) for VAX computers.

      By 1986, ANSI and ISO standard groups officially adopted the standard "Database Language SQL" language definition.
      New versions of the standard were published in 1989, 1992, 1996, 1999, 2003, 2006, 2008, 2011,[12] 2016 and most
      recently, 2023.[17]
